        content="Birhanu Manaye is a visual artist, born in 1998, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. His journey as an artist started following his older brother\'s inspirations to start drawing and sketching practices during his teenage years, which eventually led him to enroll in Abyssinia School of Art in 2015. He began painting and drawing there, where he also obtained his Certificate in Basic Fine Arts Skills. Afterwards he joined Ale School of Fine Arts and Design(ASFAD) in 2018 via the department of Printmaking, and thus he furthered his skills and received his Bachelor\'s Degree (BFA) with the highest honors in 2022. He works across a variety of media; including painting, drawing, printmaking and photography. His surroundings have infused his works in both the spiritual and artistic senses. He claims that the unseen forces and ideas that motivate and surround us â€” forces that are invisible but always at work on our bodies and minds â€” are his cradles for inspiration. The works of art serve as a testimony to how nature expresses itself and as investigations of the private moments shared only by the elements of Earth, clouds, roots and veins are few to mention. In his art, he attempts to explore issues like the subconscious, the dreamy essence of the universe, and the complexity of the Universe."
